- codes for dealing with vasp output 

- pdos_us.py
  This is the working, original version used for BDA@Au111
- If something does not reproduced this result, it's wrong!

- dos_reader.py is the main code at the moment. It should be brought
into alignment with the various "pdos" codes I've collected here...
